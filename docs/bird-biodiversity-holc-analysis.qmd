## Introduction & Overview

This data analysis project seeks to investigate how present-day environmental justice may reflect legacies of injustice in the past. The United States has a long history of racial segregation which is still visible. During the 1930's the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), as part of the New Deal, rated neighborhoods based on their perceived safety for real estate investment. Their ranking system went from A ("most safe") to D ("hazardous"). These rankings were also color-coded:

-   (A (green)

-   B (blue)

-   C (yellow)

-   D (red))

These rankings were then used to block access to loans for home ownership. Colloquially known as "redlining", this practice has had widely-documented consequences not only for community wealth, but also health.[^1] Redlined neighborhoods have less greenery[^2] and are hotter than other neighborhoods .[^3]

A recent study -- co-authored by Dr. Millie Chapman, who was my graduate student instructor in an Environmental Data Science class taught by Carl Boettiger that I took at UC Berkeley in 2020 -- found that redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to, it has also shaped our observations of biodiversity.[^4]

[^4]: Ellis-Soto, D., Chapman, M., & Locke, D. H. (2023). Historical redlining is associated with increasing geographical disparities in bird biodiversity sampling in the United States. Nature Human Behaviour, 1-9.

Community or citizen science, whereby individuals share observations of species, is generating an enormous volume of data. Ellis-Soto and co-authors found that redlined neighborhoods remain the most undersampled areas across 195 US cities. This gap is highly concerning, because conservation decisions are made based on these data.

## Data

### EJScreen

To understand the current environmental, demographic, and public health conditions at a census block group level in LA County, I will be working with data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool.

According to the [US EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/purposes-and-uses-ejscreen):

> This screening tool and data may be of interest to community residents or other stakeholders as they search for environmental or demographic information. It can also support a wide range of research and policy goals. The public has used EJScreen in many different locations and in many different ways.
>
> EPA is sharing EJScreen with the public:\
> - to be more transparent about how we consider environmental justice in our work,\
> - to assist our stakeholders in making informed decisions about pursuing environmental justice and,\
> - to create a common starting point between the agency and the public when looking at issues related to environmental justice.

EJScreen provides a wide range of environmental and demographic information on the US at the Census [tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract) and [block group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group) levels.

In this analysis, I will be working with block group data that has been downloaded from the [EPA site](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data). To understand the associated data columns, I explored the Technical Documentation and column description spreadsheet available via that same link. There are also [limitations and caveats](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/limitations-and-caveats-using-ejscreen) of the data, which you can read up on.

### Mapping Inequality

A team of researchers, led by the [Digital Scholarship Lab](https://dsl.richmond.edu/) at the University of Richmond have digitized maps and information from the HOLC as part of the [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58) project.

In this project, I will be working with maps of HOLC grade designations for Los Angeles. Information on the data can be found [here](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data).[^5]

### Biodiversity observations

The [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org) is the largest aggregator of biodiversity observations in the world. Observations typically include a location and date that a species was observed.

In this analysis, I will be working observations of birds from 2022.

bird_data <- bird_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2022) 

# checking to see if CRS match
cat("Do the CRS match?", st_crs(la_redlining) == st_crs(bird_data))
```

## Exploring EJ Screen Data: Population Demographics & Environmental Hazards

To explore the EJ Screen data, I'll explore income levels and proximity or exposure to environmental hazards data on a census block group level.

### Wastewater exposure

**Context:** From the documentation of the EJ Screen data, we can find information on the `P_PWDIS` column, which I'll be referring to as percentile wastewater discharge: "The wastewater discharge indicator quantifies a block group's relative risk of exposure to pollutants in downstream water bodies. This is achieved using toxicity-weighted concentrations in stream reach segments within 500 meters of a block centroid, divided by distance in meters, presented as the population-weighted average of blocks in each block group." (note: this is for the standard PWDIS column, not the percentile column)

Here I'll map wastewater discharge by census block groups in LA County. I've indicated which census block groups are above the 95th percentile of national values for wastewater discharge by adding a centroid to those census block groups.

```{r wasterwater-subset}
# selecting the percentile wastewater discharge column
la_waste <- los_angeles %>% select("P_PWDIS")

# finding the block groups (rows) that are above the 95th percentile
la_over_95 <- la_waste %>% filter(P_PWDIS > 95)

# making centroids for our top 5th percentile subset of data to plot later
la_centroids_95 <- st_centroid(la_over_95)

```

```{r wastewater-plot, message=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# making our plot
wastewater_plot <- tm_shape(la_waste) +
  tm_fill(fill = "P_PWDIS", # coloring block groups by wastewater discharge 
          lwd = 0.1, # thinner lines for better visibility
          title = "Wastewater Discharge (Percentile)") + # updating legend title
  tm_shape(la_centroids_95) + # adding centroids
  tm_dots(col = "chartreuse", # coloring centroids to stand out/be more visible
          alpha = 0.7, 
          size = 0.1) + # 0.2 was also too large to see the big cluster of them in the middle-right side of the map
  tm_add_legend(type = "dots", # labeling my centroids on the map
                labels = "Census block groups above 95th Percentile",
                fill = "chartreuse") + 
  tm_graticules(lwd = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + # adding graticules for orientation and scale
  tm_compass(type = "8star", size = 2, # adding compass for orientation
             position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("right", "bottom")) + # adding scale bar for more legible scale
  tm_title(text = "LA County Census Block Groups by Wastewater Discharge"
           , size = 1 # i had a hard time getting the tm_title size argument to work for making the title legible :(
           )

# viewing the plot
wastewater_plot

```

As you can see, this plot includes two islands (part of the Channel Islands) that we do not have data for. We can crop to a close-up view of the bulk of LA county in our future plots:

```{r la-crop}
# our current dataset includes two islands in which data was not collected. Because we have no data for them, let's crop our shapefile to get a more clear view of the mainland portion of LA that we have data for:
# use a bbox to isolate LA
la_crop <- st_crop(x = los_angeles, y = st_bbox(la_redlining))

# check that crop is a Los Angeles without Channel Islands
tm_shape(la_crop) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_compass()

```

The EJ Screen data we're working with contains numerous other environmental hazard variable and demographic information, including respiratory cancer rates, proximity to Superfund sites, different air quality rates, income levels, and more. These variables are all also available as percentiles compared to national average rates for each metric.

To further this data exploration, and to give context for our future bird observation data exploration, I'll investigate three more variables in the EJ Screen dataset.

### Income level assessment

First, I'll find the percent of census block groups in which less than 5% of the population is considered low income. In the documentation for this data, the `LOWINCPCT` variable is defined as "the percent of a block group's population in households where the household income is less than or equal to twice the federal 'poverty level'."

```{r percent_lowinc}
rich_la <- los_angeles %>% 
  filter(LOWINCPCT < 0.05)

# Briana reminded me that NA values shouldn't be counted here, so I subtracted them from the total number of rows
# finding the number of rows that have LOWINCPCT data in our filtered dataset, in case filtering for values below 0.05 didn't catch them
true_rows_rich <- nrow(rich_la) - sum(is.na(rich_la$LOWINCPCT))

# finding the number of rows in our original dataset that have LOWINCPCT data
true_rows_inc_la <- nrow(los_angeles) - sum(is.na(los_angeles$LOWINCPCT))

# finding the percent of census block groups that satisfy our conditions
pct_rich_la <- true_rows_rich / true_rows_inc_la * 100

print(paste0("In Los Angeles County, the percent of census block groups in which less than 5% of the population is considered low income is ", round(pct_rich_la, 2), "%"))
```

### Air quality & Superfund proximity

Next, I'll find the percent of census block groups that are above the 80th percentile for Particulate Matter 2.5 *and* for Superfund proximity.

```{r percentile_la}
# finding the number of rows in our LA dataset that have non-NA values for P_PM25
pm_true_la <- nrow(los_angeles) - sum(is.na(los_angeles$P_PM25))

# finding the number of rows in our LA dataset that have non-NA values for P_PNPL
superfund_true_la <- nrow(los_angeles) - sum(is.na(los_angeles$P_PNPL))

# selecting the rows (census block groups) that are above the 80th percentile for PM 2.5
pm80_la <- los_angeles %>% 
  filter(P_PM25 > 80)

# selecting the rows (census block groups) that are above the 80th percentile for Superfund proximity
superfund80_la <- los_angeles %>% 
  filter(P_PNPL > 80)

# finding the percent of census block groups in LA that are above the 80th percentile for PM 2.5 concentrations,  dividing by the number of rows with PM 2.5 percentile data in the original dataset
pct_pm80_la <- nrow(pm80_la)/pm_true_la * 100

# finding the percent of census block groups in LA that are above the 80th percentile for superfund proximity, dividing by the number of rows with superfund percentile data in the original dataset
pct_superfund80_la <- nrow(superfund80_la)/superfund_true_la * 100

# finding the census block groups that are above the 80th percentile for both PM 2.5 and superfund proximity
both_80_la <- los_angeles %>% 
  filter(P_PM25 > 80 & P_PNPL > 80)

# finding the percent of census block groups that fit both of these conditions, not filtering for NAs this time in the rows in our original dataset to show more of the data
pct_both80_la <- nrow(both_80_la)/nrow(los_angeles) * 100

print(paste0("In Los Angeles County, ", round(pct_pm80_la, 2), "% of census block groups are above the 80th percentile for Particulate Matter 2.5"))

print(paste0("In Los Angeles County, ", round(pct_superfund80_la, 2), "% of census block groups are above the 80th percentile for Superfund proximity"))

print(paste0("In Los Angeles County, ", round(pct_both80_la, 2), "% of census block groups are both above the 80th percentile for Particulate Matter 2.5 AND Superfund proximity"))

```

## Exploring HOLC Grade Data

### Mapping HOLC Grades

In this section, I'll make a map displaying historical redlining boundaries, colored by HOLC grade.

Historically, HOLC Grade color codes have been:

-   A: Green
-   B: Blue
-   C: Yellow
-   D: Red

To make my visualizations more colorblind-friendly, I'm using the viridis color palette. The updated color coding is:

-   A: Yellow "#FDE725FF"

-   B: Green "35B779FF"

-   C: Blue "31688EFF"

-   D: Purple "440154FF"

```{r holc_plot, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
# setting custom viridis palette:
my_palette <- viridis(4, direction = -1)

# creating our map of historical redlining boundaries
la_plot_holc <- 
  tm_shape(la_redlining) + # adding HOLC grade layer
  tm_fill(fill = "grade", # coloring by HOLC grade, 
          title = "HOLC Grade", # updating legend title
          palette = my_palette) +  # choosing colorblind-friendly palette 
  tm_shape(los_angeles) + # adding LA census block group layer second so that we get a more zoomed-in view
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5, lwd=0.1) + # showing block groups as borders, thin and semi-transparent lines
  tm_graticules(lwd = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + # adding graticules for orientation and scale
  tm_compass(type = "8star", size = 2, # adding compass for orientation
             lwd = 0.5, # thinner line width for more legible compass
             position = c("left", "bottom")) + # making sure it doesn't cover our map
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("right", "bottom")) + # adding scale for more easy-to-interpret scale
  tm_title("Historical Redlining Boundaries in Los Angeles County") # updating title

la_plot_holc

```

The lower grades (C and D) have been linked to higher rates of exposure to environmental hazards, like the ones discussed earlier in this notebook, which has serious health and safety implications [^6].

## HOLC Grade Data + EJ Screen Data

As we can see in the map above, the HOLC grade data does not cover the full extent of our census block groups and associated data.

### Census block groups within HOLC grade areas

To bring the EJ Screen data into the Redlining analysis, I will find the number of census block groups that fall within areas with HOLC grades.

I used this image from the textbook [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-operations) to think about different approaches to this problem.

![](images/spatial-relations-geocompxr.png)

```{r la_holc_data}
# I made sure that the CRS matched in my "importing data" steps at the beginning

# Chapter 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 of the textbook Geocomputation with R, along with documentation on st_join helped me get this version, using st_within as an argument of the function st_join:
block_groups_within <- st_join(x = los_angeles, # find geometries in x
                                 y = la_redlining, # that are within y
                                 join = st_within, 
                                 left = FALSE) # perform an inner join, not a left join

num_blocks_within <- nrow(block_groups_within) 
print(paste0("There are ", num_blocks_within, " census block groups in Los Angeles County that fall within areas with HOLC grades."))
```

This value is an important baseline to understand the quantity and context of the data analysis. In the earlier map of HOLC grades, we saw that the HOLC grade data does not cover the current extent of LA County census block groups -- our analysis can only extend to the 920 census block groups that fall within these historic redlining areas.

### Current conditions by HOLC Grade

In the following table, I'll summarize current conditions based on EJScreen data within historical redlining categories using the mean of the following variables: - % low income (EJScreen column name: `LOWINCPCT`) - percentile for particulate Matter 2.5 (EJScreen column name: `P_PM25`) - percentile for low life expectancy (EJScreen column name: `P_LIFEEXPPCT`) - percentile for air toxics cancer risk (EJScreen column name: `P_CANCER`)

```{r holc_grade_summary}
# grouping our data to get the summary statistics for each HOLC grade
holc_means_summary <- block_groups_within %>% 
  group_by(grade) %>%  # grouping by HOLC grade
  st_drop_geometry() %>%  # dropping geometries for optimized processing
  summarize(low_inc_pct = round(mean((LOWINCPCT * 100), na.rm = TRUE), 3), # getting summary statistics, removing NA values 
            p_pm_25 = round(mean(P_PM25, na.rm = TRUE), 3),
            p_low_life_expectancy = round(mean(P_LIFEEXPPCT, na.rm = TRUE), 3),
            p_airtoxics_risk = round(mean(P_CANCER, na.rm = TRUE), 3)) 
# viewing output
holc_means_summary %>% gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Mean Population Values by HOLC Grade")
```

#### Discussion

Across all of the summary statistics, the lowest HOLC grade (D, historically the most redlined), has the highest values for mean percent of households that qualify as low income (annual household income is two times above the national poverty level) per census block group (`r round(holc_means_summary$low_inc_pct[4], 2)`), mean percentile for particulate matter (measured in PM 2.5) (`r round(holc_means_summary$p_pm_25[4], 2)`), mean percentile for low life expectancy (`r (round(holc_means_summary$p_low_life_expectancy[4], 2))`), and mean percentile for air toxics cancer list (`r round(holc_means_summary$p_airtoxics_risk[4], 2)`). The highest HOLC grade, A, conversely has the lowest values for all of our demographic and health hazard indicators, with a mean percent low income households per census block group of `r (round(holc_means_summary$low_inc_pct[1]))`, mean percentile for particulate matter (measured in PM 2.5) (`r round(holc_means_summary$p_pm_25[1], 2)`), mean percentile for low life expectancy (`r (round(holc_means_summary$p_low_life_expectancy[1], 2))`), and mean percentile for air toxics cancer list (`r (round(holc_means_summary$p_airtoxics_risk[1], 2))`).

Our summary statistics indicate that in neighborhoods that were rated as less safe for real estate investment in the 1930s (everything below grade A, with increasing severity), have higher percentages of the population that qualify as low-income, and compared to the national average, have higher percentiles of the population exposed to higher levels of PM 2.5 (worse air quality), have higher percentiles of the population with increased risk and exposure to cancer from air toxics, and higher percentiles of their populations have a lower life expectancy.

These summary statistics support the argument that historically redlined neighborhoods may be an indicator of level of safety for public health and safety in terms of exposure to environmental hazards [^7], which in turn supports or perpetuates institutional racism and racially differentiated risks in Los Angeles, at the very least.

## Investigating the legacy of redlining in biodiversity observations

For bird observations from 2022 that fall within neighborhoods with HOLC grades, I found the percent of observations within each redlining categories and plotted the results below.

```{r bird-join}
# I made sure that all datasets shared the same CRS when I read in the data initially

# using st_join to join the redlining data and bird observations data
joined_birds <- st_join(la_redlining, bird_data, 
                        join = st_contains # I also tried st_within, but that could potentially cover up observations that happen on borders of polygons, so I stuck with contains
                        )

# number of observations of birds in all HOLC grades
total_bird_obs <- nrow(joined_birds)

# creating a dataframe of grouped, summarized statistics (proportion of bird observations per HOLC grade)
grouped_birds <- joined_birds %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% # dropping geometries for optimized running
  group_by(grade) %>% # grouping by HOLC grade
  summarize(pct_grade = (n()/total_bird_obs) * 100) # finding the percent of observations in each HOLC grade group

grouped_birds %>% gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Bird Observations", subtitle = "% of observations per HOLC Grade" )
# block group C is the highest!
```

```{r bird_plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
# plotting our proportions of bird counts per HOLC grade

bird_obs_plot <- ggplot(data = grouped_birds) +
  # using geom_col for proportional bar plot
  geom_col(aes(x = grade, y = pct_grade,
               fill = grade)) + # coloring by HOLC grade
  labs(title = "Proportion of Bird Observations in LA by HOLC Grade", # updating title
       x = "HOLC Grade", # updating axes labels
       y = "Percent of Observations (%)",
       fill = "HOLC Grade") + # updating legend title
  theme_bw() # setting the plot theme 

# saving plot
ggsave(filename = "bird_obs_plot.png", plot = bird_obs_plot, path = here("figs"), width = 8, height = 5)

# viewing plot
bird_obs_plot

```

#### Conclusion & Limitations

Considering that we generally associate birds with more green spaces like parks, and "higher" HOLC grades would likely indicate more green spaces (as mentioned in the introduction of this assignment, redlined neighborhoods have less greenery and are hotter than other neighborhoods), these results are slightly surprising, as the higher HOLC grades have proportionately fewer bird observations. The highest proportion of bird observations are within HOLC grade C, the "second to least safe" neighborhood group for real estate investment from 1930. The proportion of observations in D are also higher than A or B, but lower than C. This could be explained by several factors.

Firstly, that birds prefer waterfront areas that are near shipping operations like ports or rivers, which may be less desirable neighborhoods to live in due to pollution, noise, odors, or other aspects that may have led to these neighborhoods being graded lower. Secondly, that neighborhoods that were historically graded lower have had less development as the city grew and rent was driven up by gentrification, leading to more empty lots or undeveloped spaces which birds may have flocked to. The higher graded neighborhoods may have had a lot of development, including higher storied buildings (like skyscrapers, high-rises) and other buildings that are less bird-friendly, despite any manufactured or artificial green spaces. This could also imply that the neighborhoods that were considered safer for real estate investments in the 1930s grew into more urban spaces, with competition to keep developing artificial structures, adding concrete and less organic features. This could be one of many factors explaining the low number of bird observations in these higher-graded areas. Another possibility is that as Los Angeles became increasingly populated and the city developed, the previously redlined block groups became more gentrified, with housing costs rising and more development of features that tenants paying higher rent may come to expect, such as proximity to green spaces. These previously redlined neighborhoods may now have more greenery than their 1930s predecessors. For further analysis, using satellite greenery/vegetation index data would be helpful in understanding the complexity of our observations.
