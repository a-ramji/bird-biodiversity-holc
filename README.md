# Bird Biodiversity by HOLC Grades in LA County
Analysis of biodiversity in bird observations in historically redlined areas in Los Angeles


## Background


## Data


**EJ Screen US EPA data:**


**HOLC grade data:**

In my analysis, I use maps of HOLC grade designations for Los Angeles. These are from digitized maps and information from the HOLC that a team of researchers, led by the [Digital Scholarship Lab](https://dsl.richmond.edu/) at the University of Richmond, synthesized and made accessible as part of the [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58) project.
- More information on this data can be found [here](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=downloads).

**Bird observations/biodiversity data:**

Another key part of my analysis is the bird biodiversity data. For this I use...
- Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data 
-  Available from https://www.gbif.org/
